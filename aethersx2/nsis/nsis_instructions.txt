  PCSX2 NSIS Installer Instructions
-------------------------------------

 * Install NSIS (tested with 3.01), make sure to include the "Modern User Interface"
*** Make sure "nsDialogs" is checked to be installed in the Plugins group of the NSIS installer.

 * Install the Inetc plugin for NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in)
   ( Use the Winamp forum link on that page to find the most recent release )

 * Install NSIS Script: Advanced Uninstall Log (you can find it on NSIS wiki)
   ( Currently at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Advanced_Uninstall_Log_NSIS_Header )

    * If using NSIS 3.0+ (at the current time, the AdvUninst.zip hosted at the NSIS wiki URL above is version 1.0, so please let me know if this changes!)
        * Locate AdvUninstLog.nsh in "Program Files(x86)\NSIS\Include" 
        * On line 428, change "!undef ID ${__LINE__}" to "!undef ID"

 -----------------------------------------------
  Building plugins to include in the installer
 -----------------------------------------------

 * Plugins must be built before running the NSIS script or they will not be included in the installer

 * Load the PCSX2 Suite solution and rebuild all in the following targets:
    * Release SSE2
    * Release SSE4
    * Release AVX2

-----------------------------
  Compiling the NSIS scripts
-----------------------------

 * Once you have built the required PCSX2 plugins and pcsx2.exe; you are ready to compile! :)

 * Open MakeNSIS.exe and compile both nsi scripts in THIS order:
 1. pcsx2_full_install.nsi
 2. pcsx2_shared_init.nsi

   Output executables will be generated to the local git repo; in the "pcsx2/nsis" folder.

      Recommendations to Developers
--------------------------------------------

From Air:  I use Eclipse to edit NSIS scripts.  Do a google search for 'nsis eclipse' and it
should take you to the NSIS wiki with instructions on how to set up a NSIS environment in
Eclipse.  This typically only takes me a few minutes (yes it's really that painless).  Via
Eclipse you can use F2 and F3 for online help and context help on NSIS commands, and the syntax
highlighting is very clean and NSIS-specific.  Additionally it'll give you Visual Studio-style
hyperlinks for errors during compilation, so that you can simply click on an error and be taken
right to the offending line of code.  Highly recommended! :)
