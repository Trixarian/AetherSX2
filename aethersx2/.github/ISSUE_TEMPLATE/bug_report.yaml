        ## Important: Read First

        Please do not make support requests on GitHub. Our issue tracker is for tracking bugs and feature requests only
        If you need help configuring the emulator please make a request on our forums or contact us on discord

        If you are unsure, start with [discord](https://discord.com/invite/TCz3t9k) or the [forums](https://forums.pcsx2.net/index.php)

        Please make an effort to make sure your issue isn't already reported

        ### Please Avoid Issues Pertaining to the Following:
        - We are **not** accepting bug reports for **PSX mode** at this time
          - If you are interested in helping contribute to PSX mode please do so on the forums. Otherwise our recommendation is that you use a [proper PSX emulator](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/PlayStation_emulators)
        - We do **not** accept issues relating to **upscaling** at this time
          - We are aware of the various problems with upscaling. The issue spans many games and having hundreds of issues for the same fundamental issues isn't particularly helpful. There are several workarounds for graphical problems that come as a result of upscaling
          - Please try your game at native resolution before creating an issue
          - If your bug is the result of upscaling please use the forums or discord for assistance with various upscaling workarounds. Additionally, the unofficial PCSX2 [Wiki](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Main_Page) often lists various fixes for upscaling issues
