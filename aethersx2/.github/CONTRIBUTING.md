## Just Starting Out

## Pull Request Guidelines

The following is a list of *general* style recommendations that will make reviewing and merging easier:

*   Commit Messages
    *   Please try to prefix your commit message, indicating what area of the project was modified.
        *   For example `gs: message...`.
        *   Looking at the project's commit history will help with keeping prefixes consistent overtime, *there is no strictly enforced list*.
    *   Try to keep messages brief and informative
    *   Remove unnecessary commits and squash commits together when appropriate.
        *   If you are not familiar with rebasing with git, check out the following resources:
            *   CLI - https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history
            *   GUI (SourceTree) - https://www.atlassian.com/blog/sourcetree/interactive-rebase-sourcetree
*   Code Styling and Formatting
    *   [Consult the style guide](https://github.com/tadanokojin/pcsx2/blob/coding-guide/pcsx2/Docs/Coding_Guidelines.md)
    *   Run `clang-format` using the configuration file in the root of the repository
        *   Visual Studio Setup - https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clangformat-support-in-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/
        *   IMPORTANT - if you are running `clang-format` on unrelated changes (ie. formatting an entire file), please do so in a separate commit.
            *   If you cannot scope your `clang-format` to just your changes and do not want to format unrelated code.  Try your best to stick with the existing formatting already established in the file in question.
